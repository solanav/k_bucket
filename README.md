# What is this?
The intention of this piece of code is to create a p2p protocol.

# Goals
1. Privacy. The protocol should be encrypted end to end and one should not know where communications are comming from.
2. Resistant. The bootstraping should be completely decentrilized and the communications should work even when a large number of nodes are offline.
3. Intelligent. The network will have to identify nodes that are benefitial to the network and nodes that are either trying to attack the network or get benefits without contributing to it.
